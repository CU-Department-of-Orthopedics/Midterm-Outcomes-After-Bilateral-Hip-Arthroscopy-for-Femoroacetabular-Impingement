Abstract

Background: Bilateral hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has demonstrated good outcomes at short-term follow-up, with significant improvements in pain, hip function, and patient-reported outcomes, coupled with a complication rate similar to that of unilateral surgery.

Purpose: To investigate whether, in patients with bilateral symptomatic FAI, simultaneous bilateral hip arthroscopic surgery is an efficacious option that produces effective midterm outcomes.

Study design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods: A prospective database of patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopic surgery between August 2012 and October 2020 was used to collect clinical data on 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of FAI. Group 2 represented a matched-pair control group of patients selected based on sex and age with signs and symptoms of unilateral FAI and in whom a single side was evaluated and treated. Differences in the International Hip Outcome Tool-12 and Non-Arthritic Hip Score scores were evaluated up to 5 years postoperatively.

Results: In total, 171 patients (235 hips) were included, of whom 64 underwent simultaneous bilateral hip arthroscopic surgery (128 hips) and a control group of 107 patients (107 hips) underwent unilateral hip arthroscopic surgery. No significant differences were observed in International Hip Outcome Tool-12 scores between the 2 groups at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years postoperatively. No significant differences were observed in Non-Arthritic Hip Score scores between the simultaneous bilateral and control groups at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years postoperatively. Overall, 18% of hips in the simultaneous bilateral group reported lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy at 2-week follow-up in comparison to 16% of hips in the control group.

Conclusion: Simultaneous bilateral hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of FAI represents a safe treatment option, producing effective midterm outcomes in appropriately selected patients.
